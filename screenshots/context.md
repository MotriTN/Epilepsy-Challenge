The Core Idea
The project solves the "Bystander Panic" problem. When someone has a seizure in public, bystanders often want to help but don't know what to do. By scanning a QR code or NFC chip on the AuraLink wearable, the bystander is instantly pulled into a guided, step-by-step medical protocol that manages the crisis for them.

Main Added Values
The Tunnel Experience: Instead of a complex website, the app provides a "tunnel"—one clear, large-scale instruction at a time (e.g., "Turn them on their side"). This eliminates decision fatigue in high-stress moments.

Time-Sensitive Triage: It solves the "missing time" issue. A bystander can tell the app if the seizure just started or if they found the person already in distress. The app adjusts its medical advice accordingly.

Automated Emergency Signaling: With just two taps, the app fetches the patient's precise GPS coordinates, generates a Google Maps link, and prepares an emergency SMS to the family. It also adapts to local emergency numbers (like 190 in Tunisia).

Post-Seizure Recovery: Once the "I'm Safe" button is pressed, the app shifts to a calming blue theme and uses Text-to-Speech to talk to the patient, telling them their name and where they are, helping them through the confusion of the post-seizure state.

The Scenario
The Crisis: Alex has a seizure in a park. A bystander see his "AuraLink" bracelet with the words "SCAN ME."

The Scan: The bystander scans the bracelet with their phone. The AuraLink app opens instantly—no download needed.

The Triage: The bystander selects "Just Now." A timer starts.

The Guidance: The app shows Step 1: "Protect the head." The bystander follows it and hits "Next."

The Escalation: At 5 minutes, the screen turns pulsing red. The app says: "SEIZURE > 5 MINS. CALL 911."

The Help: The bystander taps "Call." While waiting, they tap "SMS Family," which sends Alex’s mother a Google Maps link to his exact location.

The Recovery: As Alex wakes up, the bystander hits "I'm Safe." The app speaks: "Alex, you are safe. You are in Sfax Park. Your mother is on her way."
